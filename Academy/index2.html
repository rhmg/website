					Are you a beginner level drummer looking to increase your knowledge and skill for drumming? Or maybe a casual drummer looking to pick up
					tips to help you to progress to a better ability level?<Br><br>
					We are here to help.<br><br>
					Our drum lessons are provided by experienced Rock / Funk / Soul / Blues drummers with many years of session work
					and gigging behind them.<br><br>
					Sessions last for <span class="highlight">45 minutes</span>, and cost <span class="highlight">£20</span>. Uniquely we 
					are based in Rock Hard Studios, the Fylde's newest, biggest and best professional recording and rehearsal facility.<br><br>
					Your session will take place in the 400 square foot live room
					(<a href="../images/liveroom_thumb1.jpg" target="_new" class="bold"><b>click for a picture</b></a>).  This means that you will 
					benefit from a clean, spacious and airy custom built facility.<br><br>
					You will also be <span class="highlight">recorded</span> every 10 sessions, so you have a record of your progress.  This is 
					<span class="highlight">inclusive</span> in the price, and will be to a backing track of your choice, which will be central to
					each session.<br><br>
